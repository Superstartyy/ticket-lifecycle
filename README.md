On one of the end users during the coarse, I created tickets within the OSTicket system. As seen above these are commmon ticket problems that may occur while contininuing as a help-desk professional. This is the side of customers that may be placing the tickets, to then be resolved by the IT team!

As an Admin Agent I was able to see all visible tickets that were implemented into the system. This provided me a great perspeective on what my Chair/Boss would see when tickets are coming in and allow the supervisor to submit the SLA and assign it to a Help Desk Professional.

As a resolution of the Ticket this is the screen the end user may be able to see. At this point we have communicated clearly and effecvielyu with the paitent in need of assitance by providing our best uses of knowldege to close the ticket in a orderly fashion and time manner.
